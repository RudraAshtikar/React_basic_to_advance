Context is an state management problem, It was not a part of the core react initially but the react team thought that it is such a common problem  that we should include it to the core react itself 

Almost all react projects should include state management Therefore it is an very important topic

Context API means a global variable from which we can access everything


UserContext is the global variable 
As soon as you make a context, it gives you a provider so now user context in itself is a provider

So we apply an wrapper of user context to all the components, so that with the help of user context the componenets inside the wrapper can take access of all the states 


WE HAVE  TO MAKE A provider
------------------------------------------
 

 Understanding user context

 First we made an user context file

 const UserContext = React.createContext 
 this line helps make us this file the context file

 then we have to make a provider file which will help to provide the context 

 we made a UserContextProvider which passes the the data we recieve as it is, for that we use an object{} to pass it so that we can deal with all kinds of data

 then we create <UserContext.Provider> 
    {children }
 </UserContext.Provider>

 UserContext.Provider: This is the component that makes the context's value available to its child components. It takes a value prop, which is the data you want to share. Any component wrapped within this Provider can then access this value

     import UserContext from './UserContext';

    function App() {
      const currentUser = { name: 'John Doe', isAuthenticated: true };

      return (
        <UserContext.Provider value={currentUser}>
          {/* All components within this Provider can access currentUser */}
          <Header />
          <Dashboard />
        </UserContext.Provider>
      );
    }
