      <p>
        To write this kind of components in Vite proceed carefully as if u
        delete everything immediately vite will not work what you should do
        instead is delete these things one by one and see if the site is still
        working like when i deleted the react {"state"} command my site crashed
        and was not working so delete things one by one
      </p>

export default Chai;
// .jsx means that this is a component file
